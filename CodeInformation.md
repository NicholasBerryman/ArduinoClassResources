# Programming for Arduino
## C++
### Introduction
Arduino uses a flavour of the C++ programming language designed for use within the Arduino IDE. As such all native C++ syntax features are supported, though not all native libraries are supported and many new, Arduino-specific libraries are available. 

### Data representation
Any programming language must represent real-life information in some way in order to allow actions to be formed in response to this information.
Data in C++ may be represented in 3 ways:
* Literals
	* Values directly typed into the code
	* e.g. 4, 'a', "Hello World"
* Variables
	* Names given to a block of memory that contains some data.
	* Exact value encoded within a variable may change during program execution
	* e.g. A variable $x$ may represent the number 5 at the start of the program and the number 3 at the end
* Return values
